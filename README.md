## Repository Content
This repository includes:

* airbnb_prices.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code and analysis for the project.
* detailed_listings.csv: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features of Airbnb listings such as location, number of bedrooms, amenities, etc. You can obtain a similar dataset from Inside Airbnb.

## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:

* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through visualizations and summary statistics.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features that may help improve the predictive power of the model.
* Model Training: Training different machine learning models to predict Airbnb prices.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models and selecting the best one.
  
## Results
The final model is able to predict the prices of Airbnb listings with reasonable accuracy. Detailed results and model performance metrics can be found in the notebook.
